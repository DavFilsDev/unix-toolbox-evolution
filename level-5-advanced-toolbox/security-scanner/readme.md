# Security Scanner – File Integrity Checker (C + Bash)

## Overview

**Security Scanner** is an advanced Linux system tool written in **C and Bash** that detects unauthorized file modifications using cryptographic hashing.

It works like a simplified version of **Tripwire**, used in cybersecurity to detect malware, intrusions, and system tampering.

---

## Features

*  SHA-256 hashing for file integrity
*  Baseline database creation
*  Detect modified, deleted, and new files
*  Configurable scan paths
*  Modular C architecture (one function per file)
*  Bash automation script
*  Human-readable security reports
*  Makefile build system

---

##  How It Works

1. **Baseline Mode**

   * Computes SHA-256 hash of files
   * Stores results in `baseline.db`

2. **Scan Mode**

   * Recomputes hashes
   * Compares with baseline
   * Detects:

     * Modified files
     * Deleted files
     * New files

##  Installation

###  Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-scanner.git
cd security-scanner
```

### Build

```bash
make
```

> Requires OpenSSL (`libssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)

---

## Usage

### ➤ Create baseline

```bash
./security_scanner --baseline
```

### ➤ Scan system

```bash
./security_scanner
```

### ➤ Automated scan

```bash
bash scripts/security_scan.sh
```

## Example Output

```
[*] Scanning /home for integrity issues...
[!] Modified: /home/user/.bashrc
[+] New file: /home/user/malware.sh
[-] Deleted: /home/user/old.txt
```
